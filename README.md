# Open-AI-Gym-Cartpole-Reinforcement-Learning
Implmenting Reinforcement Learning for a Cartpole using the Open AI Gym Environment

A neural network with no hidden layers was implemented to learn how to balance a pole on a cart by controlling the carts movement to either the left or right.

It is essentially learning the control parameters for balancing a pole.

Note that this program will require the Open AI Gym environment set up.
